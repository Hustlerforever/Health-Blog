          <h3>What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly?</h3>
    
          <p >Healthy living is a way of living that helps you enjoy more aspects of your life. It is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Health is not just about avoiding a disease or illness. It is about physical, mental and social well-being too.</p>
         <p>To appreciate the importance of a healthy lifestyle, consider that it leaves you fit, energetic, and at a reduced risk of disease. In essence, the habits and activities you pick up in healthy living have a positive impact on your body and, consequently, on your life. Aspects of a healthy lifestyle include good nutrition, daily exercise, and adequate sleep, which health experts say build the foundations for continuing good health.</p>
         <p>Stress management in positive ways, like yoga or meditation, is also part of a healthy lifestyle (and beats alternatives like alcohol or opioid addiction, which has grown at an alarming rate). While it is possible to live without any bad habits to attain an extremely healthy lifestyle, most people manage with one bad habit and still live a moderately healthy lifestyle.</p>
        
         <!-- Paragraph 1-->
         <h3>Where does it go wrong?</h3>
          <p>We often neglect our habits but these are the frames which define us. To live a healthy lifestyle, you have to proactively fight the bad habits and it is thus important to know them first. Here are some of them </p>
          
          <!-- Ordered List-->
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
                <h4>Poor nutrition</h4>
                <p>Poor nutrition can impair our daily health and wellbeing and reduce our ability to lead an enjoyable and active life.
                    In the short term, poor nutrition can contribute to stress, tiredness and our capacity to work, and over time, it can contribute to the risk of developing some illnesses and other health problems such as:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <!--Unordered list within ordered list-->
                     <li>Being overweight or obese</li>
                     <li>High blood pressure</li>
                     <li>Heart disease and stroke</li>
                     <li>Mental health issues</li>
                     <li>Osteoporosis</li>
                     <li>Eating disorders.</li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Lack of physical activity</h4>
                <p>Most people think that a lack of exercise just means an increase in weight. That’s unfortunately untrue. Weight gain is one effect, certainly, but the effects of lack of enough exercises can also result in high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome (including obesity and abnormal blood cholesterol levels), coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, Type-2 diabetes, low energy levels, poor posture, and many other health issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Not getting quality sleep</h4>
                <p>Getting a good night’s sleep is incredibly important for your health. In fact, it’s just as important as eating a balanced, nutritious diet and exercising.

                    Though sleep needs vary from person to person, most adults require between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night.Major portions of the population have unhealthy sleeping behaviors, or get fewer than seven hours of sleep a night. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Smoking</h4>
                <p>For those who smoke, smoking is associated with pleasure and comfort. Some might even say that they love smoking. Some think of cigarettes as close friends that have seen them through the ups and downs of their lives. But smoking increases your risk of developing more than 50 serious health conditions.

                    Some may be fatal, and others can cause irreversible long-term damage to your health.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Lung cancer</li>
                    <li>Gum disease</li>
                    <li>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</li>
                   </ul>
                    
            </li>
            <li><h4>Drinking</h4>
                <p>The problem of drinking causes devastation to individuals, families and the larger society. Excessive intake of alcohol causes a lot of health problems including:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Disease and injury</li>
                    <li>Family breakdown</li>
                    <li>Increased risk of suicide</li>
                 </ul>
                
            </li>

            <li><h4>Other Unhealthy Habits</h4>
                <p>There are various other poor lifestyle habits that are common and piercing your health without letting you know. Here are just a few:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Too much television</li>
                    <li>Poor sitting posture</li>
                    <li>Eating too much junk food and too little healthy food</li>
                    <li>Addiction to electronic gadgets, like smartphones</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
        </ol>

         <!-- Paragraph 2-->

         <h3>What research says?</h3>
         <p>Following five areas were chosen because prior studies have shown them to have a large impact on risk of premature death. Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured:
          <!-- Unordered list-->
           <ul>
               <li>  Healthy diet, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium.
            </li>
               <li> Healthy physical activity level, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily.
            </li>
               <li>  Healthy body weight, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9.
            </li>
               <li> Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never having smoked. </li>
               <li> Moderate alcohol intake, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That’s 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.</li>
           </ul>   
        
            Researchers also looked at data on age, ethnicity, and medication use, as well as comparison data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research.</p>
        
        
         <!-- Paragraph 3-->
         <h3>How to get on right track?</h3>
         <p>First of all, you need to realize that without optimum health you cannot live a blissful life. When everything feels untidy what works is picking only one aspect of life at a time. 
            You need to fix your habits one by one with positive attitude and soon a moment will come when you will see a clear, picturasque view of your life. Here are the few tips to mend your life: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>How to get proper nutrition</h4>
                    <p>Keep your daily calorie intake to a reasonable amount. Find out how many calories you need for your age, gender, activity level and your personal weight goals (i.e., do you want to lose, gain or maintain your weight?). To help determine your calorie and nutrient needs, visit <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html" target="_blank">calorie-calculator</a>.   If you want to lose weight, consult your health care provider for a safe calorie goal and eating plan. Working with other certified advisers such a dietitian, fitness professional or wellness 
                        coach can help support you as you work toward your goals.</p>
                   <p>Try to eat more of these foods: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and some low-fat dairy products. Try to make these the basis for your meals and snacks rather than meats and other high-fat and non-nutritive foods.

                </p>

                    <h4>How to make mindset for exercising</h4>
                    <p>If you want to start exercising, the big key is finding motivation. Find a workout partner or running buddy. Try an app like Couch to 5k, which offers an introductory-level approach to running a 5k marathon. The key with building an exercise routine is to force yourself to stick to it until it becomes a habit. Eventually, you’ll become so used to working out that you’ll start to feel more uncomfortable when you skip it!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How to get quality sleep</h4>
                    <p>You have to appreciate the importance of sleep before you realize just how detrimental a poor sleep schedule can be. Being poorly rested impacts virtually every other aspect of your life, and it can have serious health impacts as well. To get a better night’s sleep, start limiting screen time before bed, avoiding caffeine, and cutting back on smoking and drinking. Regular daytime exercise, plus a regular sleeping and waking up routine will also go a long way in getting a better night’s sleep. Some sleep problems require more than just that, though, so speak with your doctor if you’re having consistent trouble falling—or staying—asleep.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Say good bye to smoking</h4>
                    <p>Quitting smoking is not easy but with commitment, it is possible. If you’re ready to quit smoking, speaking with your doctor is always a good place to start. They might recommend nicotine replacement therapy, such as pills or patches, to help you along. You’ll also want to avoid alcohol and other triggers, to make it easier on yourself.

                        Find a personal reason to quit—maybe it’s to see your children grow up, but maybe it’s as simple as saving money by eliminating an unnecessary (and expensive) habit. Stick to your plan, and don’t give up after a relapse. It happens, but what’s important is that you don’t use a single bad decision as an excuse to go back fully to a bad habit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Tips to deal with drinking</h4>
                    <p>Too much alcohol can turn into poison, both literally and figuratively. Even if you don’t want to quit drinking completely, getting a handle on your drinking can make a big, positive impact on your life. Start spacing drinks out with seltzer or water between each alcoholic beverage. Reserve alcohol for meals, or limit drinking to social occasions only. Alcoholism is a serious condition, but acknowledging the problem is the first step to recovery.</p>
